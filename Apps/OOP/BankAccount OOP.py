""" Der ICI Alistirma
The deposit and withdraw methods each change the account balance.
The withdraw method also deducts a fee of 5 dollars from the balance if the withdrawal (before any fees) results in a negative balance. 
Since we also have the method get_fees you will need to have a variable to keep track of the fees paid.
Here's one possible test of the class. 
It should print the values 10 and 5, respectively, since the withdrawal incurs a fee of 5 dollars.
